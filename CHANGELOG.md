### 🛠 Breaking changes

- `expo publish:rollback` now works more like what developers would intuitively expect - users who have already downloaded the bundle that is rolled back will also get rolled back (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/pull/1707).

### 🎉 New features

- Explain to users on init of bare projects and eject that publishing is needed before creating a release build (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/commit/3eb9e7ef50214394cca30869a031b384942d3d95).
- Created the `uri-scheme` package to easily interact with schemes on bare projects and test deep linking (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/commit/3eb9e7ef50214394cca30869a031b384942d3d95).
- `expo build:ios` and `expo build:android` now prompt you to pick a build type in order to make the options more discoverable (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/pull/1479).
- Added a shortcut to open your editor via expo-cli with the `o` hotkey (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/pull/1879).

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fix Android scheme configuration that is applied on eject (https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/7816).
- Stop adb on Windows when shutting down expo-cli server (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/pull/1876).
- Always properly terminate the bundle progress bar when completed (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/pull/1877).

### 🤷‍♂️ Chores

- Replace request with axios due to deprecation of the request package and the mountain of warnings it produces (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/pull/1809).
- Remove bootstrap from yarn start in the packages directory so it's quicker for collaborators working on expo-cli to get started (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/pull/1869).
