A fast, zero-dependency package for cutting down on common issues developers have when running `pod install`.

<!-- Body -->

## üöÄ Usage

```sh
npx pod-install
```

üëã **Notice:** This package is not limited to React Native projects, you can use it with any iOS or Xcode project using CocoaPods (like Ionic, or Flutter).

## ü§î Why?

All native packages (especially those installed with NPM) often need to explain the following:

- What is CocoaPods.
- What is gem.
- How to install CocoaPods.
- `cd` into the proper directory before running `pod install`.
- You may need run `pod repo update` to fix your project.
- Why CocoaPods requires a darwin machine.

But now you can simply instruct users to run `npx pod-install`.

This package will do the following:

- Check if the machine is darwin. 
  - If not then it'll quit with a helpful error message.
- Ensure CocoaPods CLI is installed on the machine.
  - If not then it'll try to install CocoaPods CLI, first with gem, then with homebrew.
- Check if there is an Xcode project in the current directory
  - If not then it'll try again in an `ios/` directory (if one exists).
- Run `pod install`
  - If `pod install` fails because the repo is out of date, then it'll run `pod repo update` and try again. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

For more information run `npx pod-install --help` (or `-h`)
